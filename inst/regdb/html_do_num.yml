name: html_do_num

descr: |
  Information about numbers in do files. Used in HTML files
  for interactive mapping with numbers in article tables.

  These tables are on purpose as small as possible, since
  they will be added in the HTML files, i.e.
  we omit stuff like artid.

  We still use the regmap format for better documentation.

  The table will be sorted increasingly in num.
  The index of this table (startig with 0) will be used as
  an ID for each number in the logtxt, i.e.
  we will wrap relevant number in logtxt into a <nu></nu> tag like
  <nu id="donu_25">1.345</nu>

fields:
  chunkid:
    descr: |
      A global index for the output chunk counted over the complete
      project and all log outputs for which numbers are matched
      (there might be several per line).
      Will directly describe the row in html_do_chunk starting
      with 1.
