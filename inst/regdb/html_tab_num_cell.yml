name: html_tab_num_cell

descr: |
  Information about cells with numbers in article table.
  Used in HTML files for interactive mapping with numbers in do chunks.

  These tables are on purpose as small as possible, since
  they will be added in the HTML files, i.e.
  we omit stuff like artid.

fields:

  cellid:
    type: int

  # The following three fields
  # allow to map with art_tab_cell except that we use tabpos
  # instead of tabid
  tabpos:
    type: int

  row:
    type: int

  block:
    type: int

  # The numbers in html_do_num are sorted increasingly
  # We just store the start and end index (starting with 1)
  do_num_start_ind:
    type: int

  do_num_end_ind:
    type: int

  regid:
    descr: |
      If the cell is part of a regression then we store the artices regid
      A 0 will indicate no regression
    type: int

  reg_num_type:
    descr: |
      What sort of number does the cell display. Currently
      only specified for numbers from a regression.
    type: int
    val_descr:
      0: No special characterization
      1: Regression coefficient
      2: Regression parenthesis
      3: Regression se
      4: Regresson t
      5: Regression p
      10: General regression stat
      11: Regression nobs
      12: Regression r2


  best_match_type:
    type: int
    val_descr:
      0: No match at all
      1: Best regression
      2: Regression but not best
      3: Should be regression but only noreg num is matched
      4: Best noreg match
      5: Noreg match but not best in block

  best_match_chunkid:
    type: int
    descr: |
      Chunk number of the "best" match. This will determine the
      initial color coding. Will be -1 if there is no good match.

      The background color will depend on the type:
        for a regression match bg color is constant
        for a non-regression match bg color depends on cmd_type

      The border color for noreg matches will depend on the chunk index

      The best match will be previously computed in R.

      Interactively, we will be able to color code (and link to)
      different matches by letting JS perform the matching.
