Dear Author(s),

thanks for using Codare to get feedback on your code and data supplement. Codare analyzed your code and data supplement and also tried to match the results with the tables extracted from the PDF of your manusscript (if uploaded).

In the moment, the code analysis is limited to Stata do files, but we try to extend the analysis to other languages like R and Python in the future.

<h3>Did your do files run without error?</h3>

The following table shows a summary for all Stata do files in your code supplement:

{re_sum}

{re_expl}

<h3>Can tables from your manusscript be linked to your code supplement?</h3>

If you have uploaded a PDF of your manusscript (and possible online appendix), Codare tried to extract the tables and match the numbers with corresponding commands in your Stata do files. Here is a summary:

{tab_sum}

The table shows our best guess of which do file generates the table. We also show which percentage of the numbers shown in the table can be reasonably matched to the output of the do file. We also specialized matching code for regression tables and the percentage matched to regression commands is shown in a separate column. Click on the Table name to open an HTML page that provides more details on the matching between tables and code. It also includes features like color-coded search. A detailed desscription is here: [to do create documentation]

In particular, check whether there are some errors like transcription errors. If you have corrected errors, upload the corrected version of your supplement or PDF again to Codare and analyze it once more.

If not 100% of the table can be matched but that is not due to an error in your supplement or PDF table, please just add short explanation to your reply to the data editor.

<h3>Template for README</h3>

We plan that Codare also generates a template for a README file based on the [recommended template](https://github.com/social-science-data-editors/template_README/blob/releases/README.md) by the social science data editors. This feature is not yet implemented.

<h3>Documentation and citation of data sets</h3>

One important task of the README is to document all data sources, including citations and to map data files to these sources. We plan to implement features in Codare that help with this process. So far not yet, implemented.

<h3>Further Checks</h3>

We also plan to implement some future checks based on data editors' recommendations. For example:

- Is a license file included

- Is there a main script that runs all other codes.


<h3>Network graph of data and code relationship</h3>

If you like network graphs, we have also generated [a mapping between your code files and data sets](www/data_code_network.html).
