<p>Dear Data Editor Team,<br><br>
thanks for using our pilot version of Repbox to analyse a code and data supplement. Repbox analyzed the code and data supplement and also tried to match the results with the tables extracted from the PDF of the article (if uploaded).</p>
<p>In the moment, the code analysis is limited to Stata do files.</p>

<br>
<b>Make sure that you have extracted the ZIP file that contains this HTML file. Otherwise the links in the tables below don't work.</b>

<h3>1. Did the do files run without error?</h3>

<p>The following table shows a summary for all Stata do files in the code supplement:</p>

{re_sum}


{re_expl}


<h3>2. Can tables from the manuscript be linked to the code supplement?</h3>

<p>If you have uploaded a PDF of the manuscript (and possible online appendix), Repbox tried to extract the tables and match the shown numbers with output from corresponding commands in the Stata do files. Here is a summary:</p>

{tab_sum}

<p>The table above shows for each extracted table from the article PDF the best guess of which do file generated that table. We also show which percentage of the numbers shown in the table can be reasonably matched to the output of the do file. Click on the table name to open an HTML page that shall help to understand more details on the matching between tables and code. It contains rudimentary features like color-coding and search, which have to be improved, however.</p>

<p>In particular, those page shall help to check whether the numbers in the article really correspond to the results of running the code supplement.</p>

<h3>3. Data Sets</h3>

By analysing the code in the do files, we try to assess which data sets exists, are missing and are supposed to be generated by Stata code. Below are the results.
