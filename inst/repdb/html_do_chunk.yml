      Integer index of chunk command.

      Negative if a regression command.

      Positive if a non-regression command.

      For non-regression commands used for background
      color-coding of matches.

      For regression commands background color-coding
      is determined by reg_num_type instead,
      but we might use the cmd name as info
      in the context menu.
